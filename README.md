Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition for Virtual Classrooms

As virtual classrooms become increasingly prevalent, understanding and
responding to students' emotions in real-time is crucial for effective
online education. We challenge participants to develop a machine
learning model that excels in real-time emotion recognition within
virtual classroom environments. This model should process multi-modal
data, like audio, video, and text inputs from students, and accurately
detect a range of emotions, such as confusion, engagement, frustration,
or excitement. The solution should empower educators with actionable
insights, enabling them to adapt their teaching methods and provide
personalised support to students based on their emotional states
